In this section, ideas for further projects and how to improve the current
design are presented.
\subsection{Android Version}
Since the higher end Zyqn development boards have official support for very
recent Android versions, it would be great to migrate to project to one such
platform, as discussed in \Cref{ssec:issueandroidversion}.
On a longer project it might make sense to create a custom hardware design to
achieve this.

This would probably solve the issue discussed in \Cref{ssec:issuetouchscreen} as
well as it seems to be relevant to the ZedBoard.
Also, Android natively supports external touch devices since version 6, so the
hardware drivers are more sophisticated.

\subsection{Image Processing Hardware}
Image or video processing filters, which consume much more area on the \gls{fpga} on the one hand and have a much higher processing effort on the other hand, would be a very suitable application for a partial reconfigurable \gls{iot} device. At the Vivado IP Catalog, there are some cores, which would fit requirements for an efficient image and video processing purpose. These cores uses a AXI-Stream interface for the connection to the rest of the fabric. At this laboratory project these cores couldn't be used, because there was no license for generating a bitstream, which includes these cores, provided.
