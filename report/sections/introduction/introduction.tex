This project is an extension and improvement of the previous project \cite{oldrepo} based on the Digilent ZedBoard. The purpose of this project is to implement a partial reconfigurable \gls{iot} device, which can exchange parts of the synthesised hardware during runtime for
a suitable application. Android is set up to run on the Xilinx Zynq software processing unit on board of the Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit.
An application is presented that applies filters to given images. 
These filters may be subject to updates in the future and the app is able to download such updates and apply them to the \gls{pl} using dynamic partial reconfiguration.
