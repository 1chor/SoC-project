The purpose of this project is to implement a partial reconfigurable \gls{iot}
device, which can exchange parts of the synthesized hardware during runtime for
a suitable application.
Android is set up to run on the Zynq software processing unit on board of the
Digilent ZedBoard.
An application is presented that applies filters to given images.
These filters may be subject to updates in the future and the app is able to
download such updates and apply them to the \gls{pl} using dynamic partial
reconfiguration.
