In general, we have shown in our work that \gls{dpr} can be a useful method to
exchange various applications based on hardware accelerators in \gls{iot}
devices.
Exchanging different filters for image or video processing applications is only
one useful application where \gls{dpr} can be an efficient method in terms of
\gls{fpga} resources.
Replacing different kinds of cryptographic algorithms or other functionalities
are a useful application for an exchangeable \gls{dpr} implementation as well.
Finally there is a widely spread demand on powerful \gls{iot} devices, which
can exchange some specific hardware blocks for different aims during
runtime in a simple download process.
