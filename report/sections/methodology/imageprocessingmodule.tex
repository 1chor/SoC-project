The following three types of image filters have been designed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Red-Filter
\item Green-Filter
\item Blue-Filter
\end{itemize}
These simple filters read pixel data from an \gls{axi} interface and filter out
all channels except one.
The red filter filters out everything but the red channel\ldots.
Figure \ref{fig:imagefilter} describes the principle of the filter
functionality.
The logic of these filters is connected to the \gls{axi}-Lite Bus.
All three filters share a common Wrapper-Interface and are accessible by a
common Linux-Device-Driver.\\

The different cores are added to the system design via the concept described in
section \ref{sssec:partialreconfigurationsetup} at the address $0x7E430000$ with
the size of $64K$.
The logic behind the common wrapper uses 2 software accesible registers, each
32-bit wide:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	Address & Name \\
	base     & write\_reg\\
	base + 4 & read\_reg\\
\end{tabular}\\
The value of the write\_register is processed by the synthesized filter logic
and the result is written to the read\_register.
The related Linux device driver (\ref{sssec:linuxkernelmodules}) iterates over
the raw \gls{rgb} data written to the device driver file and stores the filtered
data which can then be read back from the device driver file.
