The Xilinx ZCU102 Evaluation Kit is a development platform for the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ \gls{mpsoc}.
It integrates an ARM Cortex-A53 64-bit quad-core processor (up to $1.5 GHz$) and a Cortex-R5 dual-core real-time processor (up to $600 MHz$) based \gls{ps} and Xilinx \gls{pl} UltraScale architecture in a single device. Also included are on-chip memory, multiport external memory interfaces, and a rich set of peripheral connectivity interfaces.

For this project, the \gls{pl} needs to be configured with peripherals for the
processor that are needed by the Linux kernel as well as the hardware
accelerators.
The resulting system must then be partitioned for the dynamic partial
reconfiguration.
This is discussed in \Cref{ssec:zynqhardwaredesign}.

The \gls{ps} needs to be configured with all the software that Android needs to
boot, to interact with the hardware accelerators and to dynamically reconfigure
the \gls{pl}.
This is done in \Cref{ssec:zynqsoftwaredesign}.

The complete design is available as a git repository at~\cite{repo}.
File paths within this document may refer to the root directory of the git
repository by using \emph{<repo>}.
To interact with the ZCU102 Evaluation Kit, multiple interfaces are used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A command line interface is available over an \gls{uart} interface
	\item Ethernet is used to access the internet
	\item Graphical output is available over DisplayPort
	\item Peripherals can be attached via \gls{usb}
\end{itemize}
To achieve the best android experience, a touchscreen is attached via \gls{hdmi}
(for graphics) and \gls{usb} (for the \gls{hid}).
\note{change Graphical input for touchscreen}

To automate the extensive build process, two scripts are available in the git
repository.
\emph{<repo>/bootimage/generate\_without\_android.sh} compiles the Linux kernel and the kernel modules, u-boot, the bitstreams, \gls{fsbl}, \gls{pmufw}, the device tree, the ARM Trusted Firmware and finally the boot image. To build android, the script \emph{<repo>/bootimage/generate\_including\_android.sh} can be executed.

Both scripts rely on makefiles of the underlying components they are building. This means that components that were not changed since the last build are not going to be recompiled. This saves build time during development.
